## How To Use

Drag an item to the location that you found it in. Alternatively highlight worlds by clicking on them and then double click on items to mark them as collected in that world. Clicking on a marked item will return it to the item pool. (if not using drag and drop controls then only a single click on an item is required)

The question marks connected to each world denote the number of important checks in a world. If hints are loaded these will be set automatically as reports are tracked. If hints are not loaded they can be increased or decreased with the scroll wheel or by selecting a world and using page up / page down

If a hint file is loaded into the tracker reports must be tracked correctly. Incorrectly tracking a report 3 times will lock you out of tracking that report and receiving its hint. Hovering over already tracked reports will also display their hint text.

## Auto Tracker

The auto tracker functionality works by reading pcsx2's memory. Trying to run the auto tracker when pcsx2 is closed will not work and closing pcsx2 while the auto tracker is running will stop it.

In addition to automatically tracking the important checks, the auto tracker tracks your stats as well as the starting weapon you chose. One thing to keep in mind for stats is that during cutscenes and some fights they values they show will not be correct. If using the broadcast window the auto tracker will also track drive form levels and growth abilities. Currently there isn't a way to track these yourself or see them in the main window.

Valor form is not being automatically tracked due to the flag for it being obtained being set anytime you open the summon command menu. Final form will only be tracked automatically if it is found before being forced (both normally or through light and dark).

If you are playing from a saved tracker file be sure to load it before turning on the auto tracker or everything will be placed into the world you are currently in. Also if you are playing a seed across multiple sessions do not start a new session from a save point in STT or the checks there will be tracked incorrectly for now.

When playing multiple seeds in a row be sure to fully close and reopen pcsx2 or wait to start the auto tracker again after starting a new game to make sure the memory has been reset

## Thanks

* Tommadness
  * Created the broadcast window and the framework from which the auto tracker was built. Spent a ton of time helping figure out bugs and solutions to get the auto tracker working.
* Televo
  * Made all of the icons the tracker uses that weren't taken straight from the game (some modified very slightly by me)
* Sonicshadowsilver2
  * Made the GoA mod that the randomizer itself is built on and provided tons of useful information to help create the auto tracker
